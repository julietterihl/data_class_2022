# data_class_2022
Work completed as part of my master's coursework in investigative journalism at Arizona State University's Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.

My markdown on "Analyzing the Hong Kong protests using ACLED data," which was created in R Studio, can be viewed [here](https://julietterihl.github.io/data_class_2022/rihl_finalmemo.html).

And my explainer on creating tables with reactable can be found [here](https://julietterihl.github.io/data_class_2022/Rihl_Explainer.html).
